# Projects

## SunTrack Tool 
#### *Graduation project*

This is a mandatory project that spans over the course of the last 5th year and is in cooperation with a company.

In cooperation with the company [Hella](https://www.hella.info/) we(a team of two people) were entrusted with the task of developing a tool to track, simulate and calculate various lighting factors and the light density on a variable area with different angles.
The calculated values then were to be displayed on various graphs over the course of a configurable time span.

This project was completed from September 2021 - April 2022 and a satisfactory result and application where delievered to the partner. 

- Developed with ASP .NET Core
	- C# as backend
	- Razor with HTML, CSS and JS on frontend
	- Usage of libraries for PDF conversion, as this was a desired ouput format
- Analysis of DIN 5034-2 as standard for calculating sun-related values

- Due to the companies wish, the source code will remain sealed and only be shown as POW(proof of work) on a CV letter


## Cultivation Miracle
#### *personal project*

This is a modification(mod for short) for the game "Minecraft" and uses the Forge Modding API.
This mod is about the integration of the chinese concept of cultivation(a counter-part to the all popular magic). This will in the future combine many aspects of different novels and manhuas that tell various stories of hero-figures. 

### This project is currently on hold due to the need of understanding ceratin concepts of the game and Forge API. After working on this for quite a while and making good progress I came to the conclusion that a big project should not be the introduction to a complex game and API.

- Developed with Java and the Forge API
	- Forge is a compatability layer that modifies the minecraft source code and provides endpoints for mods so they can work together without crashing and interfering with each other


## Ligma
#### *personal project*

This mod for Minecraft depends on the eponymous pun.
After my [PR](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/9244) was merged, this project is now in development and will(after trading with a villager) trigger a random conversation with the villager with a corresponding event(diamond shower, nothing, meteor fall, etc.) and thus add a funny aspect to villagers that the player will definitely remember :D.

**Currently in development and no repo available for now.**

## Armageddon
#### *personal project*

This Minecraft mod will add a cult that wants to summon "Armageddon" aka. a meteor if the player angers them(raiding a hideout). The player will be provided with rituals, custom weapons and armour to fight against the cult and destroy the evil. More information upon release.
